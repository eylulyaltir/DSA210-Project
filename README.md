**Analyzing the Impact of Weather on my Personal Spending**

I am Eylül Yaltır and for my DSA210 Term Project I want to analyze, in a data-driven approach, the relationship between the weather and my spendings using meteorological data and my bank transactions.

**Motivation**

Weather conditions influence human behaviour including spending habits. When the humidity is high, when it is raining or snowing etc. our behaviours and decisions change depending on these conditions. Understanding these dependencies can contribute to a better understanding of personal finance management and behavioural economics. To summarize, with this project I hope to:
  - Find the relationship between the weather conditions and the potential correlation of these conditions with my personal spendings.
  - By categorizing my spendings, uncover correlations such as reduced transportation costs during extreme cold.
  - By statistical modeling, identify trends and if possible predict future spendings according to the weather forecasts.

**Project Goal**

This project aims to analyze the impact of weather conditions on personal spending habits by examining bank transactions with related meteorological data. By examining this relationship we can gain an insight into our dependencies to weather conditions and in a more detailed approach, if we catagorize the transaction data we can identify which habit is more visible on a specific weather. Through data visualization and modeling this project can show the spending trends and help us manage our personal finance better and predict our future spending which will help us optimize our financial decisions and budgets. As a result I will test:
  **H0**: Weather conditions have no significant impact on personal spending behaviour.
  **H1**: Weather conditions significantly influence personal spending behaviour (e.g. reduced outdoor spending in extreme weather conditions)

**Data Sources**

This project utilizes two primary data sources: personal bank transaction records and weather data. 

Firstly, to provide transaction records for this project I will use my own Akbank spending history. Using my banking app I am able to access to my transactions for the required time period in csv format. The problem that I came across in this step is the categorization of the spendings but because I will use the data of a manageable time period I can manually enter the categories in the csv file. 

Secondly, I need to access to the weather data of the specified time period. After doing some research for the most efficient weather site for this project, I decided to use Visual Crossing. This site allows the user to download the historical weather conditions as a dataset and it includes all the crucial variables such as temperature, wind speed, "feels like" temperature etc.
