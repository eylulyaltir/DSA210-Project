**Analyzing the Impact of Weather on my Personal Spending**

I am Eylül Yaltır and for my DSA210 Term Project I want to analyze, in a data-driven approach, the relationship between the weather and my spendings using meteorological data and my bank transactions.

**Motivation**

Weather conditions influence human behaviour including spending habits. When the humidity is high, when it is raining or snowing etc. our behaviours and decisions change depending on these conditions. Understanding these dependencies can contribute to a better understanding of personal finance management and behavioural economics. To summarize, with this project I hope to:
  - Find the relationship between the weather conditions and the potential correlation of these conditions with my personal spendings.
  - By categorizing my spendings, uncover correlations such as reduced transportation costs during extreme cold.
  - By statistical modeling, identify trends and if possible predict future spendings according to the weather forecasts.

**Project Goal**

This project aims to analyze the impact of weather conditions on personal spending habits by examining bank transactions with related meteorological data. By examining this relationship we can gain an insight into our dependencies to weather conditions and in a more detailed approach, if we catagorize the transaction data we can identify which habit is more visible on a specific weather. Through data visualization and modeling this project can show the spending trends and help us manage our personal finance better and predict our future spending which will help us optimize our financial decisions and budgets.
